DESCRIPTION
    This program implements a decision-tree based machine learning algorithm
    to classify data.  It uses the ID3 (Interactive Dichotomiser 3) 
    algorithm.


USEAGE
    Python is required to run the code. To build a decision tree from 
    training data, run 

    $ python builddt.py train_data_filename dt_filename

    where "train_data_filename" is the name of the file from which to make the
    decision tree, and dt_filename is the name of the file to which you would
    like to save the constructed decision tree.  

    Then, to classify data, run

    $ python applydt.py test_data_filename dt_filename

    where test_data_filename is the data you wish to classify, and dt_filename
    is the file where the decision tree was saved by builddt.py
