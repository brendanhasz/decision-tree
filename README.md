# Decision Tree
`decision-tree` is a program which uses a decision tree machine learning algorithm to classify data. It constructs and applies decision trees to training and test data files.  The program uses the `ID3` (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) algorithm.


# Usage
[`python`](http://www.python.org/) is required to run the code.  

## Input format
`builddt` and `applydt` take CSV (Comma Separated Value) formatted files.  The first column in the training file is the class, and the other columns are the attributes.  The test file should be the same, just without the first column of class data.  `applydt` outputs a file in the same format as the training data file.

Some converters are supplied in `/parsers`.  For example, to convert training gene sequence data which has no comma separators, run

```bash
$ python parsers/gene_seq.py -train train_data_filename train_CSV_filename
```

And to convert test gene sequence data, run

```bash
$ python parsers/gene_seq.py -test test_data_filename train_CSV_filename
```

## Building a Decision Tree from training data
To build a decision tree from training data, run

```bash
$ python builddt.py train_data_filename dt_filename
```

where "train_data_filename" is the name of the file from which to make the decision tree, and "dt_filename" is the name of the file to which you would like to save the constructed decision tree.

## Classifying test data
To classify data using a constructed decision tree, run

```bash
$ python applydt.py test_data_filename dt_filename output_filename
```

where "test_data_filename" is the data you wish to classify, "dt_filename" is the file where the decision tree was saved by builddt.py, and "output_filename" is the file to which you wish to output the classified results.

## Bootstrap Aggregating (Bagging)
An often more accurate method for classifying data using decision trees is bagging.  This involves taking random samples of the original data to create new training samples, and then training a decision tree on that data, and repeating the process many times. This process is called "Bootstrapping."  Then, when classifying data, we run the data through each tree generated by bootstrapping, and take the answer with the most "votes," which is called "Bagging" (bootstrap aggregating).

To run the Bagging routine, run

```bash
$ python bagdtbuild.py training_data_filename bag_model_filename
$ python bagdtapply.py test_data_filename bag_model_filename classified_output_filename
```
